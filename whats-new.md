#### Bot Framework SDK for Microsoft Teams (GA)
The Bot Framework SDK v4.6 release fully integrates support for building Teams bots allowing users to use them in channel or group chat conversations. By adding a bot to a team or chat, all users of the conversation can take advantage of the bot functionality right in the conversation.  [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics-teams)]

#### Bot Framework for Power Virtual Agent (Preview)
Power Virtual Agent is designed to enable business users to create bots within a UI-based bot building SaaS experience, without having to code or manage specific AI services. Power Virtual Agents can be extended with the Microsoft Bot Framework through Skills, allowing developers and business users to collaborate in building bots for their organizations. [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-virtual-agent/overview)]

#### Bot Framework SDK for Skills (Preview)

- **Skills for bots**: Create reusable conversational skills to add functionality to a bot. Leverage pre-built skills, such as Calendar, Email, Task, Point of Interest, Automotive, Weather and News skills. Skills include language models, dialogs, QnA, and integration code delivered to customize and extend as required. [[Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/botframework-solutions/overview/skills/)]

- **Skills for Power Virtual Agent - Coming!**: For bots built with Power Virtual Agents, you can build new skills for these bots using Bot Framework and Azure Cognitive Services without needing to build a new bot from scratch. 

#### Adaptive Dialogs (Preview)
Adaptive Dialogs enable developers to dynamically update conversation flow based on context and events. This is especially handy when dealing with conversation context switches and interruptions in the middle of a conversation. [[Docs][48] | [C# samples][49]] 

#### Language Generation (Preview)
Language Generation enables developers to separate logic used to generate bot's respones including the ability to define multiple variations on a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, refer to conversational memory. [[Docs][44] | [C# samples][45]]

#### Common Expression Language (Preview)
Common Expression Language allows you to evaluate the outcome of a condition-based logic at runtime. Common language can be used across the Bot Framework SDK and conversational AI components, such as Adaptive Dialogs and Language Generation. [[Docs][40] | [API][41]]

### Bot Framework Composer (Preview)
Bot Framework Composer is an integrated development tool for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to build bots and conversational experiences with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Within this tool, you'll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience. [[Docs](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/blob/stable/toc.md)]

### Azure Bot Service
- **Direct Line Speech (GA)**: Bot Framework and Microsoft's Speech Services provide a channel that enables streamed speech and text bi-directionally from the client to the bot application using WebSockets on Azure Bot Service. [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/directline-speech-bot?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)] 

- **Direct Line App Service Extension (Preview)**: A version of Direct Line App Service Extension that isolates your bot from other traffic on the Bot Service by running Direct Line on your dedicated Azure App Service. This also allows bots to participate in Azure VNET configurations. A VNET lets developers create your own private space in Azure and is crucial to your cloud network as it offers isolation, segmentation, and other key benefits. [[Docs](https://aka.ms/directline-ase)]

### Bot Framework Solutions

#### Virtual Assistant Core

[Virtual Assistant Core](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-solutions#readme) : Provides a set of templates, solution accelerators and skills to help build sophisticated conversational experiences. 

New for Ignite:
- Bot Framework 4.6 support. Language Generation support enabling more natural, flexible responses.
- Context switching, Speech support, [New documentation site](http://aka.ms/virtualassistantdocs), Teams support, Multi-turn QnAMaker, 
- Android Virtual Assistant cient integrating Speech, Bot Framework and Adaptive Cards.

#### Enterprise Assistant (Preview)

Many organizations are looking to provide a centralized conversational experience across many conversational canvases for employees. This concept allows for a consolidation of many disparate bots across the organization to a more centralized solution where a master bot handles finding the right bot to handle the conversation, thus avoiding bot explosion through parent bot / skills approach. This in turn gets employees more productive and allows for a true Enterprise Virtual Assistant Experience.

The [Enterprise Assistant Sample](http://aka.ms/virtualassistantdocs)is an example of a Virtual Assistant that helps conceptualize and demonstrate how an assistant could be used in common enterprise scenarios. It also provides a starting point for those interested in creating an assistant customized for this scenario including Enterprise knowledgebase templates, productivity skills and an experimental IT Service Management (Servicenow) skill.

### Bot Framework Web Chat (GA)
Bot Framework Web Chat component is a highly customizable web-based client for the Bot Framework V4 SDK. Updates include: React upgrade to 16.8.6 to support React Hooks and stateful function components, uploaded image attachments can now include a thumbnail, and UI improvements and customizability include bubble nub, timestamp format, and customizable user and bot icons. [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-webchat-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)]

### Bot Framework CLI (GA)
BF CLI aggregates the collection of cross-platform tools into one cohesive and consistent interface. For the 4.6 release, we've ported Chatdown, QnAMaker, LuDown, and LuisGen. [[Docs](https://aka.ms/bfcli)]

## Related Services

### Language Understanding 
Language Understanding (LUIS) is an Azure service for building natural language experiences. You can quickly create enterprise-ready, custom models that continuously improve. Updates include: sophisticated hierarchical language models, import and export .lu files for an effective CI/CD process, and basic support for Arabic and Hindi (public preview). [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cognitive-services/luis/whats-new#november-4-2019---ignite)] 

### QnA Maker
QnA Maker is an Azure service that can be used to find the most appropriate answer from your custom knowledge base (KB). Updates include: multi-turn Q&A conversations, new set of languages supported for chit-chat dataset, US Government cloud support, and the ability to set the KB language for your service. [[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/whats-new)]

### Speech
Speech Services on Azure converts speech <-> text and integrates into your bot. You can use the Direct Line Speech channel in the Azure Bot Service to stream speech, create transcipt files from audio files, and neural-text-to-speech which can make the voice of your bot nearly indistinguishable from voices of the people.

- [Channel Testing](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases): 
Introduced at Microsoft Build 2019, the Bot Inspector is a new feature in the Bot Framework Emulator which lets you debug and test bots on channels like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Cortana, and more. As you use the bot on specific channels, messages will be mirrored to the Bot Framework Emulator where you can inspect the message data that the bot received. Additionally, a snapshot of the bot memory state for any given turn between the channel and the bot is rendered as well.

## Web Chat
Based on enterprise customers asks, we've added a [web chat sample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/19.a.single-sign-on-for-enterprise-apps#single-sign-on-demo-for-enterprise-apps-using-oauth) that shows how to authorize a user to access resources on an enterprise app with a bot.
