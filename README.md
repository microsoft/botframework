### [Click here to find out what's new for //build2019!](./whats-new.md#whats-new)

The Microsoft Bot Framework is a comprehensive platform for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. It includes a set of open source SDKs, tools, and services which enable developers to **build**, **test**, and **connect** bots that interact naturally with users, wherever they are. With the Microsoft Bot Framework, it is easy to create a bot with the ability to speak, listen, understand, and learn from your users with Azure Cognitive Services. 

![Bot Framework](./docs/media/Bot-Framework-header.jpg)

This repo lists the SDK, tools, and services needed to build a great conversational AI experience. Its role is to serve as a landing page and one place to find all the information required to get started.

### Bot Framework SDK v4 - (New! - version 4.5 preview)
The Bot Framework SDK v4 - Version 4.5 new capabilites in preview. 

- [Adaptive Dialog][47] | [docs][48] | [C# samples][49] :: Adaptive Dialogs enable developers to build conversations that can be dynamically changed as the conversation progresses.  Traditionally developers have mapped out the entire flow of a conversation up front, which limits the flexibility of the conversation.  Adaptive dialogs allow them to be more flexible, to respond to changes in context and insert new steps or entire sub-dialogs into the conversation as it progresses. Additionally as with other SDK V4 concepts, we have defined adaptive dialogs such that they can be defined via [declarative][50] that are interpreted at runtime; which allows us to have tooling on top of this and integrate with services. 

- [Language Generation][43] | [docs][44] | [C# samples][45] :: Learning from our customers experiences and bringing together capabilities first implemented by Cortana and Cognition teams, we are introducing Language Generation; which allows the developer to extract the embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a Language Generation runtime and file format.  Language Generation enable customers to define multiple variations on a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, refer to conversational memory, and over time will enable us to bring additional capabilities all leading to a more natural conversational experience.

- [Common Expression Language][40] | [api][41] :: Both Adaptive dialogs and Language Generation rely on and use a common expression language to power bot conversations.

#### Botkit
[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK. 

In addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].

Botkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]

### Bot Inspector (New! - Preview)
The Bot Framework Emulator has released a Beta of the new Bot Inspector feature: a way to debug and test your Bot Framework SDK v4 bots on channels like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Cortana, Facebook Messenger, Skype, etc. As you have the conversation, messages will be mirrored to the Bot Framework Emulator where you can inspect the message data that the bot received. Additionally, a snapshot of the bot state for any given turn between the channel and the bot is rendered as well. You can inspect this data by clicking on the "Bot State" element in the conversation mirror.

## Related Services

### Language Understanding 
A machine learning-based service to build natural language experiences. Quickly create enterprise-ready, custom models that continuously improve. [Language Understanding Service(LUIS)][30] allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words.

<a name="LUIS-whats-new"></a>

- **New! Roles, External Entities and Dynamic Entities** :: LUIS has added several features that let developers extract more detailed information from text, so users can now build more intelligent solutions with less effort. LUIS also extended roles to all entity types, which allows the same entities to be classified with different subtypes based on context. Developers now have more granular control of what they can do with LUIS, including being able to identify and update models at runtime through dynamic lists and external entities. Dynamic lists are used to append to list entities at prediction time, permitting user-specific information to get matched exactly. Separate supplementary entity extractors are run with external entities, and that information can be appended to LUIS as strong signals for other models.

- **New! Analytics dashboard** :: LUIS is releasing a more detailed, visually-rich comprehensive analytics dashboard. Its user-friendly design highlights common issues most users face when designing applications, by providing simple explanations on how to resolve them to help users gain more insight into their models’ quality, potential data problems, and guidance to adopt best practices.

### Adaptive Cards
[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io) are an open standard for developers to exchange card content in a common and consistent way, 
and are used by Bot Framework developers to create great cross-channel conversatational experiences.

* **Open framework, native performance** - A simple open card format enables an ecosystem of shared tooling, seamless integration between apps, and native cross-platform performance on any device.
* **Speech enabled from day one** - We live in an exciting era where users can talk to their devices. Adaptive Cards embrace this new world and were designed from the ground up to support these new experiences.
